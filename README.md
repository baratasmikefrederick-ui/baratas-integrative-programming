# NEONCORE – Futuristic Landing Page

## Description

NEONCORE is a single-page landing page I created to show a futuristic tech concept.  
It is for anyone interested in clean, modern web design and simple digital platforms.  
The purpose is to present a concept clearly and attractively using only HTML and CSS, without extra complexity.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Features

- Full-screen hero section with call-to-action button
- Futuristic and minimal design
- Multi-page navigation (Landing → Login → Signup) - Consistent UI styling across pages
- Organized content section with footer

## AI Assistance Disclosure

Yes, I used AI tools, but only for small guidance.

I used ChatGPT to suggest some layout ideas, trouble shooting, errors, and help improve the wording for the hero section and features.  
All the code, design decisions, and final implementation were written and made by me.

## Learning Reflection

From this activity, I learned how to structure a landing page using HTML and CSS and make it look clean and futuristic.  
The hardest part was making a visually appealing layout without images or JavaScript, only using CSS and text.
